It took me about 3.5 hours, but that included an overtime basketball game, an overtime hockey game, a triple-overtime hockey game, and a lot of channel-switching. Realizing that it is much easier to be an armchair whiner than it is to write a test of this nature, this test still warrants criticism.  To the credit of the AP people, they listened to people and recognized that the multiple choice portion of the test was too long for the amount of time provided and they moved from 75 to 90 minutes this year.  They also recognized that the free response portion of the test was too short–it really was way too short for years–and they reduced the amount of time for that from 105 to 90 minutes.  So far so good. The problem is that if you are going to write a 90 minute test, it should probably mean 90 minutes for a good computer science student, not 90 minutes for a good computer science teacher. For the reader with some programming expertise, it probably makes sense to have a browser tab open with the test to follow along. QUESTION: Did anyone give this test to high school teachers to find out how long they thought it would take?  I’m serious about this.  I just went through a thread on Facebook where top teachers at top schools were expressing concern about how long the test took them and the kinds of errors they made. QUESTION: I thought I taught topics other than string operators this year.  Was this a mistake?  I’ve never written a test with this much emphasis on strings and I hope I never come close. #1: My students should do pretty well on this problem.  (Maybe I’ll learn whether they internalized it based on the test results.)  I’ve actually been giving this problem as homework for about a decade, but returning random, unique numbers instead of Strings.
